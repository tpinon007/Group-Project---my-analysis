# Group-Project---my-analysis portion

This is my analysis portion for our group project. This work investigates the relationship between the percentage of Ohio voters receiving Medicare enrollments and health insurance status of people who voted for Trump or Clinton by county. This script pulls the relevant csv data files, cleans the data sets, runs calculations, and displays the relevant information in data frames. 

Data sources: datausa.ohio, census bureau, and countyhealthrankings.org
